# 100-AA: 100 Days of Algorithmic Art

After getting interested in generative art, a visual art genre, I built [Aroma of the Songs](https://aroma.ofthesongs.com) which transforms music into roses creating exploration space of a unique kind. This year, one of my new year's resolution was creating 100 generative visual art pieces before the end of 2021.

The results are mostly tentative, exploratory, and I donâ€™t feel like they need to be relevant or meaningful on any particular day. The everyday practice leads to the emergence of ideas that I consider interesting, worthy of further exploration. Some of those have been added to [selected work](https://0x48piraj.com/), this collection itself became valuable for me, and it is my pleasure to share it with anyone willing to explore coding as a creative and expressive medium.

Please do not hesitate to contact me regarding licenses to use my work, speaking opportunities, consulting or other projects.

Here are listed some of the tools I have been using:

- [[Py.Processing](https://villares.github.io/como-instalar-o-processing-modo-python/index-EN)] Processing Python mode
- [[Processing Java](https://processing.org]) Processing Java or "standard" mode
- [[p5.js](https://p5js.org)] JavaScript library from the Processing Foundation
